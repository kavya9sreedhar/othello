Othello CS2 Final Project
By: Kavya Sreedhar and Shweta Dutta, aka Team AnnEnbErg

Describe how and what each group member contributed for the past two weeks.
We wrote and tested all the code together, meeting in Annenberg lab. We would trade off typing on each other's laptops and brainstormed ideas together. We first implemented a random player and then moved on to implement a basic heuristic. We then refined our intial heuristic implementation to beat SimplePlayer consistently.

Document the improvements your group made to your AI to make it tournament-worthy. Explain why you think your strategy(s) will work. Feel free to discuss any ideas that were tried but didn't work out.
